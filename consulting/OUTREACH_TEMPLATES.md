Subject: AI for [Company]'s document workflows?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: How much time does your team spend searching through [documents type - contracts/reports/filings]?

I built an AI system that:
- Answers questions across 500+ pages in 2-3 seconds
- Shows confidence scores (so you know when to trust it)
- Provides source citations

Already tested on SEC 10-K filings with Meta, Tesla, NVIDIA.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this fits [Company]?

P.S. Here's a 2-min demo: [LINK]

Subject: Quick question about [Company]

Hi [Name],

I help companies build AI systems for document analysis (think: chatbots over internal docs, contract analysis, etc).

Do you know anyone at [Company] who handles:
- Document-heavy workflows
- Knowledge management
- Internal search/discovery

Happy to pay a referral fee if it leads to a project.

Thanks,

I built an AI that reads 500-page SEC filings in 2 seconds.

Here's what it does:
→ Ingests any document (PDF, contracts, reports)
→ Answers questions with citations
→ Compares across multiple documents
→ Tells you when it's NOT confident (no hallucinations)

Tech stack:
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Cross-encoder reranking
- 275+ tests
- Docker-ready

Looking for:
□ Beta customers who have document-heavy workflows
□ Consulting projects (RAG, AI chatbots)
□ Interesting problems to solve

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email last week about AI document analysis.

Quick update: Just finished a project where we cut document review time from 40 hours to 5 minutes for a financial services client.

Still happy to show you a quick demo if useful.
